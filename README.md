ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Lee de Byl -- a computer & data scientist based in Perth, Western Australia. I've worked with major organizations including Telstra and Chevron, specializing in statistics, systems administration, machine learning, embedded systems, and optimization.

My current research interests focus on natural language processing, high-performance computing, and artificial intelligence.

My preferred programming languages are C, Python, Haskell, Prolog and Assembler, but I am open minded.

Favourite operating systems? FreeBSD, Linux, Solaris, BeOS, Mac OS X, Windows 2000, macOS - in that order ;)
